Boggle Game Solver or Word Search in 2D Array or MXN Matrix by using DFS algorithm 
This is one of the most important problem that every programmer should know. Specially who target for the top notch companies like bla..bla...bla.
In this post , lets focus on simple but less efficient approach to solve this problem. Before we start lets understand the problem.
Problem: Given a 2D array or a MXN matrix and a given dictionary, find all possible words made of combining characters of the matrix that belong to the given matrix where:
1) Each cell represents a character
2) A valid word must be composed by following a sequence of adjacent dice—two dice are adjacent if they are horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbors.
3) A valid word can use each cell at most once.
4) A valid word must be in the given dictionary.
